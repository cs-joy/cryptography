'''
Digital signatures are a cryptographic tool to sign messages and verify message signatures in order to 
provide proof of authenticity for digital messages or electronic documents. Digital signatures provide:

    1. Message authentication - a proof that certain known sender (secret key owner) have created and 
                                signed the message.

    2. Ðœessage integrity - a proof that the message was not altered after the signing.

    3. Non-repudiation - the signer cannot deny the signing of the document after the signature is once
                         created.
